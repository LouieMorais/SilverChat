# Testing Strategy & Guidelines



<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LouieMorais/SilverChat/refs/heads/main/.project/architecture/img/silverchat-hr.png" width="100%" />


## Core Principles:
* Shift-Left Approach: Emphasize testing early and often throughout the development lifecycle.
* Automation Focus: Automate tests wherever practical (Unit, Integration, API, Regression).
* User-Centric: Prioritize testing aspects critical to the target audience (Usability, Accessibility, Safety).
* Risk-Based: Focus testing efforts on high-risk areas (Security, Core Functionality, Data Integrity).

## 1. Development Phase Testing (Continuous):
* Static Testing:
* Code Reviews (Manual): Peer review of code for logic, style, security (Ref: Code Review Checklist).
* Static Analysis (Automated): Use linters (like ESLint) and potentially static security analysis tools (SAST) to catch issues without running code.
* Unit Testing (Automated):
* Focus: Test individual functions, modules, or components in isolation (e.g., utility functions, validation logic, individual React components if frontend exists).
* Tools: Jest.
* Goal: Verify correctness of small code units, high code coverage (Ref: Code Coverage, Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage).
* Integration Testing (Automated):
* Focus: Test the interaction between different units/modules (e.g., API route handler calling database logic, component interactions).
* Tools: Jest, Supertest, Knex (for DB interactions).
* Goal: Verify that integrated parts work together as expected.

## 2. API Layer Testing (Backend):
* API Functional Testing (Automated):
* Focus: Test API endpoints directly for correct responses, status codes, and behaviour based on inputs (valid and invalid). Covers Positive and Negative Testing scenarios.
* Tools: Supertest (via Jest), Postman/Insomnia (for manual/exploratory API testing).
* Goal: Ensure API behaves according to specifications.
* API Security Testing (Manual/Automated):
* Focus: Test for common API vulnerabilities (authentication, authorization, injection flaws, rate limiting).
* Tools: Security-focused tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP), manual penetration testing (potentially later).
* Goal: Identify and mitigate security risks in the API.
* API Performance Testing (Automated - Later Stage):
* Focus: Test API endpoint response times under various loads.
* Tools: k6, JMeter, Postman (basic load tests).
* Goal: Ensure API meets performance requirements.

## 3. System & End-to-End Testing (When Frontend Exists):
* GUI Testing (Manual/Automated):
* Focus: Test the user interface elements and interactions.
* Tools: Cypress, Playwright, Selenium (for automation); Manual testing.
* Goal: Verify UI functionality and appearance.
* End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Automated):
* Focus: Test complete user flows through the application (e.g., registration, profile update, sending a message) from the UI down to the database.
* Tools: Cypress, Playwright.
* Goal: Verify that entire features work correctly from a user's perspective.
* Cross-Browser/Compatibility Testing (Manual/Automated):
* Focus: Ensure application works across supported browsers and devices.
* Tools: BrowserStack, Sauce Labs (for automation); Manual testing on different browsers.
* Goal: Provide a consistent experience.

## 4. Non-Functional & Specialized Testing:
* Usability Testing (Manual - Crucial):
* Focus: Observe real users (from target demographic) interacting with the application to identify ease-of-use issues.
* Methods: Moderated/unmoderated sessions, task analysis.
* Goal: Ensure the application is intuitive and effective for SilverChat users.
* Accessibility Testing (Manual/Automated):
* Focus: Verify compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG).
* Tools: Axe, WAVE, screen readers; Manual checks.
* Goal: Ensure inclusivity for users with disabilities.
* Performance & Load Testing (System Level - Automated - Later Stage):
* Focus: Test overall system performance, stability, and scalability under expected and peak loads.
* Tools: k6, JMeter.
* Goal: Ensure reliability and responsiveness.
* Security Testing (System Level - Manual/Automated):
* Focus: Comprehensive security assessment, including penetration testing.
* Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite; Manual expert review.
* Goal: Identify and fix system-wide vulnerabilities.
* Recovery Testing (Manual/Automated):
* Focus: Test the system's ability to recover from failures (e.g., server crash, database outage).
* Methods: Simulate failures, verify recovery procedures.
* Goal: Ensure resilience and data integrity.
* Database Testing (Manual/Automated):
* Focus: Data integrity, constraint validation, performance of complex queries, backup/restore procedures.
* Tools: SQL scripts, Knex (in tests), specialized DB testing tools.
* Goal: Ensure data correctness and database reliability.

## 5. Release Phase Testing:
* Regression Testing (Automated/Manual):
* Focus: Re-run relevant tests (Unit, Integration, E2E) to ensure no existing functionality is broken by last-minute changes. Perform targeted manual checks on affected areas.
* Goal: Prevent regressions before release.
* Smoke Testing (Automated/Manual):
* Focus: Quick tests on the core, critical functionalities after a build/deployment to ensure the system is stable enough for further testing.
* Goal: Basic build verification.
* Alpha/Beta Testing (Manual - User Feedback):
* Focus: Gather feedback from real users on functionality, usability, and bugs in a pre-release version.
* Goal: Identify real-world issues and gather user insights.
* Acceptance Testing (Manual - Stakeholder/User):
* Focus: Verify that the system meets the business requirements and user needs. Often involves User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
* Goal: Formal acceptance of the release.

## Relevance of Shift-Left Testing for SilverChat
Shift-left testing is highly relevant and beneficial for the SilverChat project.

Shift-left means moving testing activities earlier in the development lifecycle â€“ literally "shifting left" on a typical project timeline diagram. Instead of waiting until development is "complete" to start testing, you integrate testing continuously from the beginning.

### Why it's relevant for SilverChat:

* Early Bug Detection: Finding and fixing bugs early (during coding or component testing) is significantly cheaper and faster than finding them later during system testing or after release.
* Improved Quality: Building quality in from the start, through practices like TDD (which involves writing tests before code), code reviews, and continuous integration testing, leads to a more robust and reliable application. This is crucial for gaining user trust, especially with a focus on safety and companionship.
* Faster Feedback Loops: Developers get faster feedback on their code through automated unit and integration tests, allowing them to correct issues quickly.
* Reduced Risk: By continuously testing and integrating, you reduce the risk of major issues surfacing late in the project, which could delay releases or impact users negatively.
* Foundation for Automation: It encourages building a comprehensive suite of automated tests (Unit, Integration, API) which forms the backbone of regression testing and enables faster, more confident releases later on.
How we're already applying it (and can continue):

* Unit/Integration Tests: Writing Jest tests for database connections and server endpoints (Steps 11) is a core shift-left practice. We should continue this for all new backend logic and API routes.
* TDD: While we haven't strictly followed TDD for every step so far, adopting it more formally (write failing test -> write code -> refactor) for new features would strengthen the shift-left approach.
* Code Reviews: Implementing a code review process before merging changes ensures another layer of quality control early on.
* Static Analysis: Using linters helps catch syntax errors and style issues automatically as code is written.
* Early API Testing: Manually testing API endpoints with tools like Insomnia as they are developed provides quick feedback.
